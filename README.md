# Scrabble
My version of scrabble 2 player game, using a Trie data structure

I used the dictionary used for the mac from the file "/usr/share/dict/web2" and I implemented the Trie data structure
and inserted all the words into the structure. 

I add all the correct amounts of letters into a a array list of tiles known as the tile bag.

I first intialized the board with empty spaces.

This is designed to be a 2 player game but you can change the number of players in the constants at the top of the file.
